# Project 5: Customer Churn Prediction & Agentic Retention Strategy

## From Predictive Analytics to Intelligent Intervention

### Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of an **AI-driven customer analytics system** that predicts customer churn and evolves into an agentic AI retention strategist.

- **Milestone 1:** Classical machine learning techniques applied to historical customer behavior data to predict churn risk and identify key drivers of disengagement.
- **Milestone 2:** Extension into an agent-based AI application that autonomously reasons about churn risk, retrieves retention best practices (RAG), and plans intervention strategies.
