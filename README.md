## 🔮 Making Predictions

1. Navigate to the Models page
2. Select your preferred model
3. Go to the "Make Prediction" tab
4. Fill in customer information
5. Click "Predict Churn" to get results

## 📈 Understanding Results

- **Green Result**: Low churn risk - customer likely to stay
- **Red Result**: High churn risk - consider retention strategies
- Probability scores show confidence level of prediction
